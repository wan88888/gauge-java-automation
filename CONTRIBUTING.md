# Contributing to Gauge Java Automation Framework

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style Guidelines

### Java Code Style

1. Use meaningful variable and method names
2. Add comments for complex logic
3. Follow Java naming conventions:
   - Class names should be PascalCase
   - Method names should be camelCase
   - Constants should be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
4. Keep methods focused and not too long
5. Use proper exception handling

### Test Writing Guidelines

1. Each test should be independent
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
4. Clean up resources after tests
5. Add proper logging for debugging

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the documentation with details of any changes to the interface
3. The PR may be merged once you have the sign-off of other developers

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
